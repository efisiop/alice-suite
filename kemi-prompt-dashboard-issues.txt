I'm having multiple issues with my Alice Consultant Dashboard that need fixing. Here's the current situation:

**CURRENT ERRORS:**
1. JavaScript errors in browser console:
   - "Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'a.H')"
   - "SyntaxError: Can't create duplicate variable: '_0x2bcb81'"
   - "RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" (infinite recursion)

2. Database/API errors:
   - "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (user_feedback, interactions)"
   - "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'consultant_users'" (FIXED)

3. WebSocket connection:
   - "WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3001/' failed" (FIXED - server now running)

**WHAT I'VE ALREADY FIXED:**
✅ WebSocket server is now running on port 3001
✅ Database infinite recursion policy issue resolved
✅ consultant_users, user_feedback, help_requests, profiles tables are all accessible

**REMAINING ISSUES:**
❌ JavaScript stack overflow/infinite recursion in frontend code
❌ 500 server errors on some endpoints
❌ Duplicate variable declarations causing syntax errors
❌ Promise rejection errors with undefined objects

**PROJECT CONTEXT:**
- React/TypeScript consultant dashboard app
- Uses Supabase for backend (blwypdcobizmpidmuhvq.supabase.co)
- Real-time features with WebSocket on port 3001
- Located at: /Users/efisiopittau/Project_1/alice-suite/APPS/alice-consultant-dashboard/

**WHAT I NEED:**
1. Help identifying the source of JavaScript infinite recursion
2. Fix the 500 server errors on user_feedback and interactions endpoints
3. Resolve duplicate variable declaration issues
4. Fix Promise rejection with undefined object evaluations
5. Ensure the dashboard loads properly without these errors

**FILES THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT:**
- src/pages/Consultant/ConsultantDashboard.tsx (main dashboard component)
- src/services/realDataService.ts (data fetching service)
- src/hooks/useRealtimeAuth.ts (real-time auth hook)
- src/services/realtime-service.ts (WebSocket service)

The dashboard should display consultant data, reader statistics, help requests, and feedback - but currently crashes with these JavaScript errors. Can you help me debug and fix these issues step by step?
