# Alice Reader Testing Dashboard Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for setting up a shared dashboard to track beta testing progress for the Alice Reader application. The dashboard will provide real-time visibility into test coverage, issue status, and overall testing health.

## Dashboard Objectives

- Provide at-a-glance visibility into testing progress
- Track issue discovery, resolution, and verification
- Monitor test coverage across features and environments
- Identify bottlenecks and risk areas
- Support data-driven testing decisions

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Test Coverage Tracker

**Purpose:** Monitor which features and scenarios have been tested

**Key Metrics:**
- Percentage of test cases executed
- Coverage by feature area
- Coverage by device/browser
- Coverage by user persona

**Visualization:**
- Heat map of test coverage by feature
- Progress bars for each testing phase
- Calendar view of testing activity

### 2. Issue Tracker

**Purpose:** Track issues discovered, their status, and resolution

**Key Metrics:**
- Total issues by priority (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- Issues by status (New, Confirmed, In Progress, Fixed, Verified)
- Issues by feature area
- Issue discovery and resolution trends

**Visualization:**
- Stacked bar chart of issues by priority and status
- Trend line of open vs. resolved issues
- Pie chart of issues by feature area

### 3. Quality Indicators

**Purpose:** Assess the overall quality of the application

**Key Metrics:**
- Critical path stability percentage
- Regression rate (reopened issues)
- User experience consistency score
- Performance benchmarks

**Visualization:**
- Gauge charts for key quality indicators
- Trend lines for performance metrics
- Stability score by feature

### 4. Testing Activity

**Purpose:** Monitor testing effort and productivity

**Key Metrics:**
- Test cases executed per day
- Issues found per test hour
- Verification rate
- Testing hours by feature

**Visualization:**
- Activity timeline
- Productivity charts
- Resource allocation breakdown

## Dashboard Setup Options

### Option 1: GitHub Project Board

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Create a new GitHub Project (Beta) in the repository
2. Set up the following views:
   - Test Coverage (Table view)
   - Issues (Board view)
   - Quality Metrics (Table view)
   - Testing Activity (Table view)

3. Configure custom fields:
   - Test Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
   - Coverage Percentage (Number)
   - Priority (P0, P1, P2, P3)
   - Feature Area (Authentication, Reader, AI, Consultant, etc.)
   - Environment (Desktop, Mobile, Browser-specific)

4. Create automation rules:
   - When issue is labeled "verified", move to Verified column
   - When test case is marked "completed", update coverage percentage

**Advantages:**
- Integrated with GitHub Issues
- No additional tools required
- Customizable views and fields
- Built-in automation

**Limitations:**
- Limited visualization options
- Manual updates required for some metrics
- Less robust reporting capabilities

### Option 2: Trello Board

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Create a new Trello board named "Alice Reader Beta Testing"
2. Set up the following lists:
   - Test Planning
   - In Progress
   - Completed
   - Issues (P0)
   - Issues (P1)
   - Issues (P2)
   - Issues (P3)
   - Verified

3. Create labels for:
   - Feature areas
   - Test environments
   - Test types
   - Blockers

4. Set up Power-Ups:
   - Calendar (for scheduling)
   - Custom Fields (for metrics)
   - GitHub (for integration)
   - Chart (for visualization)

5. Create card templates for:
   - Test cases
   - Issue reports
   - Daily status updates

**Advantages:**
- User-friendly interface
- Visual organization
- Mobile app available
- Power-Ups for extended functionality

**Limitations:**

- Manual synchronization with GitHub
- Less customizable automation

### Option 3: Google Sheets Dashboard

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Create a new Google Sheet with the following tabs:
   - Dashboard (summary and visualizations)
   - Test Cases (tracking execution)
   - Issues (tracking status)
   - Metrics (calculations and data)
   - Settings (configuration)

2. Set up the Dashboard tab with:
   - Summary metrics at the top
   - Coverage charts in the middle
   - Issue tracking charts at the bottom
   - Status indicators on the right

3. Create data entry forms for:
   - Test case execution
   - Issue reporting
   - Daily metrics

4. Set up formulas for automatic calculations:
   - Coverage percentages
   - Issue resolution rates
   - Quality indicators

5. Create charts and visualizations:
   - Stacked bar charts for issues
   - Line charts for trends
   - Pie charts for distribution
   - Gauge charts for key metrics

**Advantages:**
- Highly customizable
- Powerful data analysis
- Familiar interface for many users
- Real-time collaboration

**Limitations:**
- Manual data entry required
- No direct integration with GitHub
- Limited automation capabilities
- Requires careful formula management

## Recommended Option

For the Alice Reader beta testing, we recommend using **GitHub Project Board** for the following reasons:

1. Direct integration with the existing GitHub repository
2. Built-in issue tracking and linking to code
3. Customizable views for different stakeholders
4. Sufficient visualization for core metrics
5. No additional tool costs or setup complexity

## Dashboard Setup Process

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Create the GitHub Project Board
2. Configure views and custom fields
3. Set up automation rules
4. Import existing test cases and issues

### 2. Daily Maintenance

1. Update test case status at the end of each testing day
2. Verify that issues are properly categorized and labeled
3. Check that automation rules are functioning correctly
4. Update quality metrics based on testing results

### 3. Reporting Process

1. Generate weekly snapshot of dashboard metrics
2. Export key visualizations for weekly report
3. Analyze trends and patterns
4. Prepare recommendations based on dashboard data

## Dashboard Access and Permissions
