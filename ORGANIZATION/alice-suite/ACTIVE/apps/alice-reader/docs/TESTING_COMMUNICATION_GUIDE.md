# Alice Reader Testing Communication Guide

## Overview

Effective communication is essential for successful beta testing. This guide outlines the communication channels, protocols, and expectations for the Alice Reader beta testing team.

## Communication Channels

### 1. Slack/Teams Channel

A dedicated channel will be created for real-time communication during testing.

**Channel Name:** `#alice-reader-beta-testing`

**Purpose:**
- Quick questions and answers
- Real-time issue reporting
- Sharing screenshots and videos
- Coordination between testers
- Announcements from test lead

**Guidelines:**
- Use threads for discussions about specific issues
- Use @mentions sparingly and appropriately
- Pin important messages for easy reference
- Use emoji reactions to acknowledge messages
- Keep conversations focused on testing

### 2. Issue Tracking System

All issues will be tracked in a centralized system.

**Tool:** GitHub Issues

**Categories:**
- Bug: Something isn't working as expected
- Enhancement: Suggested improvements
- Question: Need clarification
- Documentation: Issues with documentation

**Labels:**
- Priority: P0, P1, P2, P3
- Component: Authentication, Reader, AI, Consultant, etc.
- Status: New, Confirmed, In Progress, Fixed, Verified
- Environment: Desktop, Mobile, Browser-specific

**Issue Creation Process:**
1. Check if the issue has already been reported
2. Create a new issue using the template
3. Add appropriate labels
4. Link to related test case if applicable
5. Notify the team in Slack/Teams if critical (P0/P1)

### 3. Daily Standup Meetings

Short, focused meetings to coordinate testing activities.

**Schedule:** Daily at 9:00 AM

**Format:**
- 15 minutes maximum
- Each tester answers:

  - What will I test today?
  - Are there any blockers?
- Test lead provides updates on fixed issues

**Guidelines:**
- Be punctual
- Keep answers brief
- Save detailed discussions for after the standup
- Remote participants use video if possible

### 4. Issue Triage Meetings

Regular meetings to review and prioritize issues.

**Schedule:** Daily at 1:00 PM

**Participants:**
- Test lead
- Developer representative
- Testers who reported issues

**Agenda:**
- Review new issues
- Confirm priority and severity
- Assign issues to developers
- Discuss workarounds for open issues
- Plan verification testing for fixed issues

### 5. Weekly Review Meetings

Comprehensive review of testing progress.

**Schedule:** Fridays at 3:00 PM

**Participants:**
- All testing team members

### 6. Documentation Repository

Central location for all testing documentation.

## Escalation Protocol

### When to Escalate

- P0 (Critical) issues that block testing
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss or corruption issues
- System-wide failures
- Repeated test environment issues

### Escalation Path

1. **First Level:** Report in Slack/Teams channel with @test-lead mention
2. **Second Level:** Direct message to test lead and developer lead
3. **Third Level:** Email to project manager with "URGENT" in subject line
4. **Final Level:** Phone call to designated emergency contact

### Information to Include

- Brief description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact on testing
- Screenshots or videos if applicable
- Any attempted workarounds

## Buddy System Guidelines

### Pair Formation

- Pairs will be formed based on complementary skills and experience
- Each pair will include one tester with technical background and one with domain expertise
- Pairs will rotate weekly to ensure fresh perspectives

### Collaboration Expectations

- Pairs should coordinate testing activities daily
- Use screen sharing for collaborative testing sessions
- Review each other's test cases and issue reports
- Share knowledge and techniques
- Provide backup for each other during absences

### Pair Testing Techniques

- **Driver/Navigator:** One tester executes while the other observes and directs
- **Ping Pong:** Alternate between testing and reviewing
- **Tour-Based:** Take turns leading "tours" through different aspects of the application
- **Divide and Conquer:** Split testing areas but review findings together
