# üéØ Cursor Agent: Kimi K2 + Claude Code Integration Guide

## üìã **Quick Agent Setup (30 seconds)**

Your environment is **pre-configured**. Use these commands immediately:

```bash
# Test integration
claude "What can you help me with in this codebase?"

# Get help with current task
claude "Analyze the current file and suggest improvements"

# Quick code assistance
claude "Explain this function: $(cat current_file.ts)"
```

## üöÄ **Essential Cursor Commands**

### **File-Level Operations**
```bash
# Analyze current file
@kimi-assist analyze this file

# Generate tests for current file
claude "Write comprehensive tests for $(basename $CURRENT_FILE)"

# Refactor current code
claude "Refactor $(basename $CURRENT_FILE) for better performance"
```

### **Project-Level Operations**
```bash
# Initialize project context
claude init

# Get project overview
claude "What is the architecture of this monorepo?"

# Find and fix issues
claude "Find potential bugs in the authentication system"
```

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Start development session
claude "I'm working on feature X, help me plan the implementation"

# Code review
claude "Review the changes in git diff"

# Testing
claude "Create unit tests for the new component I just created"
```

## üìÅ **Context-Specific Prompts**

### **When Working on Alice Reader**
```bash
claude "How can I improve the reading experience in Alice Reader?"
claude "Optimize the text highlighting performance"
claude "Add a new feature for vocabulary tracking"
```

### **When Working on Consultant Dashboard**
```bash
claude "Enhance the dashboard analytics for consultants"
claude "Add real-time student progress updates"
claude "Improve the feedback management system"
```

### **When Working on Shared Packages**
```bash
claude "Refactor services to use the shared API client package"
claude "Consolidate duplicate types between apps"
claude "Add type safety to the shared API client"
```

## üîß **Advanced Cursor Integration**

### **Using @kimi-assist Command**
```typescript
// In Cursor terminal/command palette:
@kimi-assist "Explain the monorepo structure"
@kimi-assist "Create a new React component for user profiles"
@kimi-assist "Optimize the build process"
```

### **Custom Cursor Shortcuts**
```json
// Add to Cursor settings.json
{
  "customCommands": [
    {
      "name": "kimi-analyze",
      "prompt": "claude \"Analyze the current file and suggest improvements\""
    },
    {
      "name": "kimi-test",
      "prompt": "claude \"Write comprehensive tests for $(basename $CURRENT_FILE)\""
    },
    {
      "name": "kimi-refactor",
      "prompt": "claude \"Refactor $(basename $CURRENT_FILE) following best practices\""
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìä **Development Patterns**

### **TDD with Kimi**
```bash
# 1. Write test first
claude "Create failing test for new user authentication feature"

# 2. Implement feature
claude "Implement authentication to pass the test I just created"

# 3. Refactor
claude "Refactor the authentication code for better structure"
```

### **Code Review Workflow**
```bash
# Review current changes
claude "Review my git diff and suggest improvements"

# Security audit
claude "Check for security vulnerabilities in the changes"

# Performance check
claude "Profile the new code for performance issues"
```

## üéØ **Specific Cursor Contexts**

### **When Opening a New File**
```bash
claude "Explain what this file does: $(basename $CURRENT_FILE)"
claude "Show me the dependencies for this file"
claude "Suggest improvements for this file"
```

### **After Making Changes**
```bash
claude "Review the changes I made and provide feedback"
claude "Update documentation for the modified code"
claude "Create tests for the new functionality"
```

### **Before Committing**
```bash
claude "Review git diff and suggest commit message"
claude "Check if tests pass with the changes"
claude "Ensure code follows project standards"
```

## üö® **Quick Troubleshooting in Cursor**

### **If Commands Fail**
```bash
# Check configuration
claude /config

# Test basic functionality
claude "echo 'Cursor integration working'"

# Reset if needed
source ~/.zshrc
```

### **Performance Issues**
```bash
# Use specific context
claude "Focus on $(basename $CURRENT_FILE) only"

# Reduce scope
claude "Analyze lines 1-50 of $(basename $CURRENT_FILE)"
```

## üîó **Cursor + Kimi Best Practices**

### **1. Context Management**
```bash
# Always initialize context
claude init

# Use session management
claude /resume [session-id]

# Clear context when switching tasks
claude /clear
```

### **2. Efficient Prompting**
```bash
# Be specific about file context
claude "In $(basename $CURRENT_FILE), optimize the handleSubmit function"

# Include line numbers when relevant
claude "Review lines 25-45 in $(basename $CURRENT_FILE)"
```

### **3. Iterative Development**
```bash
# Start with planning
claude "Plan the implementation for feature X"

# Implement in steps
claude "Implement step 1: create component structure"
claude "Implement step 2: add state management"
claude "Implement step 3: add styling"
```
