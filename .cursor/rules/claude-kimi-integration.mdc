# Claude Code Kimi K2 Integration

This project is configured to use the Kimi K2 model as the backend for the Claude Code IDE.

The `kemi-claude-cli.sh` script is the designated tool for this purpose. It correctly sets the required environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) to route all API requests to the Moonshot AI endpoint.

**Usage:**

To interact with the Claude Code IDE using the Kimi K2 backend, execute the following command:

```bash
./kemi-claude-cli.sh "Your prompt for Claude Code"
```

**Example:**

```bash
./kemi-claude-cli.sh "Explain recursion in Python with a simple code example."
```

All token usage and associated costs will be billed to the Moonshot AI account associated with the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`.
