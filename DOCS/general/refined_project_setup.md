# Alice AI Companion Project Setup Plan

## Overview
This plan establishes a systematic approach to develop the Alice AI Companion, which enhances the physical reading experience of "Alice in Wonderland" through interactive digital assistance.

## Phase 1: Project Foundation Setup

### 1.1 Create claude.md
**Purpose**: Main interaction guide for Claude throughout development

**Content Requirements**:
- Project context and vision summary
- Standard Claude instructions:
  - Always read planning.md at conversation start
  - Check tasks.md before beginning work
  - Mark completed tasks immediately
  - Add newly discovered tasks
- Alice AI Companion specific guidelines:
  - Emphasize reader comfort and non-intrusive design
  - Maintain physical-digital integration philosophy
  - Follow ethical considerations (privacy, transparency)

### 1.2 Generate planning.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive project blueprint

**Key Sections**:
- **Vision Statement**: Bridge physical "Alice in Wonderland" with digital assistance
- **Core Philosophy**: Supportive, non-intrusive companion acting as "helpful, quiet librarian"
- **Architecture Overview**:
  - Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
  - Frontend: React with TypeScript
  - AI Integration: LLM API fine-tuned for Alice context
- **Database Schema**:
  - profiles, books, definitions, verification_codes
  - interactions, consultant_triggers
- **Security & Privacy**: Role-based access, purpose limitation, no unsolicited contact

### 1.3 Create tasks.md
**Purpose**: Actionable development roadmap

**Milestone Structure**:

#### Milestone 1: Backend Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up Supabase project
- [ ] Create PostgreSQL schema (6 tables)
- [ ] Import Tier 1 definitions content
- [ ] Generate unique book verification system
- [ ] Test database connectivity

#### Milestone 2: Reader Application Core
- [ ] Implement onboarding flow with verification
- [ ] Build Three-Tier Assistance System:
  - Tier 1: Instant definitions with feedback buttons
  - Tier 2: AI assistant with LLM integration
  - Tier 3: Human consultant request system
- [ ] Create subtle AI prompt system
- [ ] Develop Reader Dashboard
- [ ] Add reader feedback mechanism

#### Milestone 3: Publisher Dashboard
- [ ] Build secure consultant interface
- [ ] Implement reader monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Enable consultant-triggered AI prompts
- [ ] Create help request management system
- [ ] Develop analytics and reporting
- [ ] Implement role-based access control

#### Milestone 4: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Phase 2: Claude Code Implementation

### 2.1 Environment Setup
1. **File Preparation**:
   - Download claude.md, planning.md, tasks.md as markdown files
   - Place in project root directory
   - Ensure files are properly formatted

2. **Claude Code Activation**:
   - Navigate to project directory
   - Activate plan mode: `shift + tab + tab`
   - Initialize with prompt: "Please read planning.md, claude.md, and tasks.md to understand the Alice AI Companion project, then complete the first task from tasks.md"

### 2.2 Development Best Practices

#### Session Management
- **Progress Tracking**: Regular session summaries in claude.md
- **Context Preservation**: Use prompt "Please add a session summary to claude.md summarizing what we've done so far"
- **Task Management**: Update tasks.md status after each completion

#### Quality Assurance
- **Code Review**: Ensure adherence to TypeScript best practices
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for critical functions
- **Documentation**: Maintain inline comments and API documentation

## Phase 3: Key Success Factors

### 3.1 Technical Excellence
- **Performance**: Optimize for quick definition lookups
- **Scalability**: Design for multiple concurrent users
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and data protection

### 3.2 User Experience
- **Simplicity**: Maintain clean, intuitive interface
- **Accessibility**: Ensure compatibility across devices
- **Responsiveness**: Fast load times and smooth interactions

### 3.3 Ethical Compliance
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about data use
- **Privacy**: Strict adherence to purpose limitation
- **Consent**: Proper onboarding and permission management

## Phase 4: Deployment Strategy

### 4.1 Pre-Launch
- Security audit and penetration testing
- Performance testing under load
- User acceptance testing with beta readers

### 4.2 Launch
- Staged rollout with monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics
- User feedback collection system

### 4.3 Post-Launch
- Continuous monitoring and optimization
- Regular security updates
- Feature enhancement based on user feedback

## Success Metrics
- User engagement rates with three-tier system
- Reader satisfaction scores
- Consultant efficiency metrics
- System performance benchmarks
- Privacy compliance adherence

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**: Backup systems, error handling
- **Privacy Risks**: Regular compliance audits
- **User Adoption**: Comprehensive onboarding
- **Scalability**: Load testing and optimization
