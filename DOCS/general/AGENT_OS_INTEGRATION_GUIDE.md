# Agent OS Integration Guide for Alice Suite

## Overview

This guide explains how Agent OS integrates with your existing project management system (`claude.md`, `planning.md`, `tasks.md`) to provide a comprehensive development workflow.

## 🎯 **Integration Philosophy**

**Preserve + Enhance**: We've kept your existing system intact while adding Agent OS capabilities for feature-specific development.

## 📁 **File Structure & Purpose**

### **Existing System (Preserved)**
```
alice-suite/
├── claude.md              # Session tracking & Claude instructions
├── planning.md            # Project vision & architecture
└── tasks.md               # Milestone-based task tracking
```

### **Agent OS System (Added)**

## 🔄 **Workflow Integration**

### **When to Use Each System**

#### **Use Existing System For:**
- ✅ **General development** and maintenance
- ✅ **Bug fixes** and troubleshooting
- ✅ **Milestone tracking** and progress updates
- ✅ **Session summaries** and progress documentation
- ✅ **Architecture decisions** and planning

#### **Use Agent OS For:**
- ✅ **New feature development** with detailed specifications
- ✅ **Complex implementations** requiring systematic approach
- ✅ **Feature enhancements** with clear requirements
- ✅ **Technical specifications** and API design
- ✅ **Test-driven development** workflows

## 🚀 **How to Use the Integrated System**

### **For New Features (Agent OS Workflow)**

1. **Create Feature Specification:**
   ```bash
   @create-spec "Enhance quiz system with AI-powered question generation"
   ```

2. **Review Generated Specs:**
   - Check `.agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`
   - Review `spec.md`, `technical-spec.md`, `tasks.md`
   - Approve or request changes

3. **Execute Implementation:**
   ```bash
   @execute-tasks
   ```

4. **Update Session Tracking:**
   - Add session summary to `claude.md`
   - Update `tasks.md` with completed milestones

### **For General Development (Existing Workflow)**

1. **Check Current Status:**
   - Read `planning.md` for project vision
   - Check `tasks.md` for current milestones
   - Review `claude.md` for recent progress

2. **Work on Tasks:**
   - Follow existing development process
   - Update `tasks.md` as you complete items
   - Add new tasks as discovered

3. **Document Progress:**
   - Add session summary to `claude.md`
   - Update any relevant documentation

## 📋 **Updated Project Setup Checklist**

### **1. Initial Setup (Already Complete)**
- [x] Create PRD (Project Requirements Document)
- [x] Generate claude.md with session tracking
- [x] Create planning.md with project vision
- [x] Create tasks.md with milestone structure
- [x] Install and configure Agent OS
- [x] Create Agent OS product documentation

### **2. Daily Development Workflow**

#### **For New Features:**
1. [ ] Use `@create-spec` to generate detailed specifications
2. [ ] Review and approve specifications
3. [ ] Use `@execute-tasks` to implement systematically
4. [ ] Add session summary to `claude.md`
5. [ ] Update `tasks.md` with completed milestones

#### **For General Development:**
1. [ ] Read `planning.md`, `tasks.md`, and `claude.md`
2. [ ] Work on current milestone tasks
3. [ ] Update `tasks.md` immediately when tasks are completed
4. [ ] Add new tasks as discovered
5. [ ] Add session summary to `claude.md`

### **3. Session Management**
- [ ] Always read `planning.md` at the start of new conversations
- [ ] Check `tasks.md` before starting work
- [ ] Mark completed tasks immediately
- [ ] Add any new tasks discovered
- [ ] Add session summary to `claude.md` after each session

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **When to Use Agent OS Commands**
- **`@create-spec`**: For new features, enhancements, or complex implementations
- **`@execute-tasks`**: After spec approval, for systematic implementation
- **`@analyze-product`**: For understanding existing codebase structure

### **When to Use Existing System**
- **General development**: Bug fixes, maintenance, simple improvements
- **Milestone tracking**: Updating progress on major project phases
- **Session documentation**: Recording what was accomplished

### **Integration Points**
- **Session summaries**: Always add to `claude.md` regardless of workflow
- **Milestone updates**: Update `tasks.md` when major milestones are completed
- **Architecture decisions**: Document in `.agent-os/product/decisions.md`
- **Progress tracking**: Use both systems to maintain comprehensive documentation

## 🔧 **Technical Integration**

### **Standards Alignment**
- Agent OS standards in `~/.agent-os/standards/` are customized for your React/TypeScript/Supabase stack
- These standards apply to both Agent OS and general development
- Maintain consistency across both workflows

### **Documentation Cross-References**
- Agent OS specs can reference existing documentation
- Session summaries in `claude.md` can reference Agent OS specs
- Both systems contribute to comprehensive project documentation

### **Version Control**
- All files are tracked in Git
- Agent OS specs are versioned alongside existing documentation
- Maintain clear commit messages for both systems

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### **Integration Success Indicators**
- [ ] Both systems work without conflicts
- [ ] Development workflow is clear and efficient
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- [ ] Progress tracking is accurate across both systems
- [ ] Team members understand when to use each system

### **Quality Assurance**
- [ ] All new features have proper specifications
- [ ] Session summaries are comprehensive
- [ ] Milestone progress is accurately tracked
- [ ] Standards are consistently applied
- [ ] Documentation is maintained and current

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **For your next feature**: Try using `@create-spec` to generate detailed specifications
2. **For general development**: Continue using your existing workflow
3. **For session tracking**: Always update `claude.md` with progress summaries
4. **For milestone updates**: Keep `tasks.md` current with completed work

This integrated approach gives you the best of both worlds: systematic feature development with Agent OS and flexible general development with your existing system.
