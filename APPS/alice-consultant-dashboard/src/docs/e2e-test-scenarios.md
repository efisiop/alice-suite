## Test Data

For end-to-end testing, we need to set up test data:

1. **Test Users:**
   - Regular user: `test-user@example.com` / `Password123!`
   - Consultant: `test-consultant@example.com` / `Password123!`

2. **Test Verification Codes:**
   - Valid codes: `ALICE123`, `WONDERLAND`, `RABBIT`, `TEAPARTY`, `CHESHIRE`
   - Invalid code: `INVALID`

   - Use the first few chapters of "Alice in Wonderland"

## Test Environment

For end-to-end testing, we need to set up a test environment:

1. **Test Database:**
   - Separate from production
   - Pre-populated with test data
   - Reset between test runs

2. **Test Server:**
   - Separate from production
   - Connected to the test database
   - Accessible only to testers

## Continuous Integration

End-to-end tests should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Run tests on every pull request
2. Run tests before deployment to staging
3. Run a subset of critical tests before deployment to production

## Reporting

Test results should be reported and tracked:

1. Generate test reports after each run
2. Track test coverage over time
3. Track test failures and fixes
4. Use screenshots and videos for failed tests
