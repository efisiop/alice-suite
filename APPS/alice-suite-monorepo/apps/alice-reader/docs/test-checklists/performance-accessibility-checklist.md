- [ ] Write operations are efficient
- [ ] Database connections are properly managed

### Offline/Poor Connection
- [ ] App degrades gracefully with slow connection
- [ ] Error states are handled appropriately
- [ ] Data is cached effectively
- [ ] Retry mechanisms are implemented for failed requests
- [ ] User is notified of connection issues
- [ ] Critical functionality works offline where possible
- [ ] App recovers gracefully when connection is restored

## Accessibility Testing
