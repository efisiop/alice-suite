## Testing Process

### Daily Testing Routine

1. **Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)**
   - **Test Planning Meeting** (15 min)
     - Review day's testing goals
     - Assign specific test areas
     - Address questions/concerns
   
   - **Focused Testing Session** (2.5 hours)
     - Execute tests for primary focus area
     - Document issues discovered
     - Note areas needing deeper investigation

2. **Afternoon (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)**
   - **Issues Review Meeting** (30 min)
     - Review morning findings
     - Prioritize critical issues
     - Adjust afternoon testing if needed
   
   - **Continued Testing/Regression** (2.5 hours)
     - Complete remaining tests
     - Verify fixes for previous issues
     - Explore edge cases
   
   - **Daily Wrap-up** (30 min)
     - Document test coverage
     - Summarize findings
     - Plan next day's focus

### Test Execution Process

For each test case:

1. **Preparation**
   - Ensure test environment is ready
   - Reset relevant test data if needed
   - Review test case and expected outcomes

2. **Execution**
   - Follow test steps methodically
   - Document actual outcomes vs. expected
   - Capture screenshots for issues
   - Note any unexpected behavior

3. **Issue Documentation**
   - Create detailed issue reports for failures
   - Classify severity and priority
   - Include reproduction steps
   - Link issues to test cases

4. **Verification**
   - After fixes, re-test the specific functionality
   - Perform regression testing on related features
   - Update issue status

## Issue Management

### Priority Classification

1. **P0 (Critical)**
   - Blocks core functionality
   - Causes data loss/corruption
   - Major security vulnerability
   - Affects all users
   - **Example:** Unable to log in, verification always fails

2. **P1 (High)**
   - Major feature broken
   - Significant user experience issue
   - Affects many users
   - Has workaround but is cumbersome
   - **Example:** Definition popups display but with wrong content

3. **P2 (Medium)**
   - Feature partially broken
   - Moderate user experience issue
   - Affects some users
   - Has reasonable workaround
   - **Example:** Reading statistics occasionally display incorrect data

4. **P3 (Low)**
   - Minor visual glitches
   - Non-critical feature issue
   - Affects few users
   - Minimal impact on experience
   - **Example:** Animation sometimes stutters on page transition

### Issue Tracking Process

1. **Issue Discovery**
   - Tester identifies an issue during testing
   - Issue is documented using the issue report template
   - Screenshots or videos are captured

2. **Issue Triage**
   - Issues are reviewed during daily meetings
   - Priority and severity are confirmed
   - Issues are assigned for investigation

3. **Issue Resolution**
   - Developer fixes the issue
   - Developer notes the fix in the issue report
   - Issue status is updated to "Fixed"

4. **Issue Verification**
   - Tester verifies the fix
   - Regression testing is performed
   - Issue status is updated to "Verified" or reopened
