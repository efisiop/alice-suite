- Verify readability and usability at all screen sizes

### Task 3.3: Orientation Testing
- Test both landscape and portrait orientations on mobile devices
- Verify layout adjusts correctly when device is rotated
- Ensure reading experience is optimized for both orientations

## Phase 4: Performance and Accessibility Testing

### Task 4.1: Performance Testing
- Measure and optimize load times
- Test rendering performance
- Monitor resource usage
- Test behavior under poor network conditions
- Implement performance monitoring

### Task 4.2: Accessibility Testing
- Verify WCAG AA compliance
- Test with screen readers
- Verify keyboard navigation
- Check color contrast and text resizing
- Test with assistive technologies

## Phase 5: Final Refinement and Documentation

### Task 5.1: Bug Fixing and Refinement
- Prioritize and fix identified bugs
- Implement UI/UX improvements
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
- Enhance error handling and recovery

### Task 5.2: User Documentation
- Create reader documentation
- Create consultant documentation
- Prepare onboarding guides
- Document common workflows and troubleshooting

### Task 5.3: Developer Documentation
- Update technical documentation
- Document API endpoints
- Create deployment guides
- Document database schema and migrations

## Phase 6: Launch Preparation

### Task 6.1: Pre-Launch Checklist
- Complete the pre-launch checklist
- Verify all critical functionality
- Ensure security measures are in place
- Prepare monitoring and support

### Task 6.2: Deployment Script
- Create and test deployment scripts
- Document deployment process
- Prepare rollback procedures
- Set up continuous integration/deployment

### Task 6.3: Monitoring Setup
- Implement application monitoring
- Set up error tracking
- Configure performance monitoring
- Establish alerting thresholds

## Testing Methodology

### Test Types
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user journeys
4. **Manual Tests**: Guided testing using checklists
5. **Exploratory Tests**: Unscripted testing to find edge cases

### Test Environment
- Use the dedicated test environment
- Reset test data between test sessions
- Use test personas for consistent testing
- Document all issues in the issue tracker

### Bug Prioritization
- **P0**: Critical issues that block core functionality
- **P1**: High-priority issues that significantly impact user experience
- **P2**: Medium-priority issues that should be fixed before launch
- **P3**: Low-priority issues that can be addressed post-launch

## Launch Strategy

### Phased Rollout
1. **Internal Testing**: Team members and stakeholders
2. **Closed Beta**: Small group of invited users
3. **Open Beta**: Larger group with public signup
4. **Soft Launch**: Limited production release
5. **Full Launch**: Complete public release

### Success Metrics
- User engagement (time spent reading)
- Feature usage (dictionary lookups, AI interactions)
- Help request resolution rate
- User feedback sentiment
- Technical performance metrics

## Post-Launch Plan

### Monitoring
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor error rates
- Collect user feedback
- Analyze usage patterns

### Iteration
- Prioritize improvements based on feedback
- Implement regular update schedule
- Plan feature enhancements
- Address technical debt

### Support
- Provide user support channels
- Update documentation based on common questions
- Engage with user community
- Train support team
